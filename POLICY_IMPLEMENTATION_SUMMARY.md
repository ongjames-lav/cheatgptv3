# CheatGPT3 - Rules-Based Policy Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The **Rules-Based Policy** system has been successfully implemented and fully tested. This is the core behavioral analysis engine that processes pose detection data and applies sophisticated rules to identify violations and potential cheating behaviors.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Core Implementation
- ✅ **PolicyEngine Class**: Complete behavioral analysis engine
- ✅ **Severity System**: Color-coded violation levels (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)
- ✅ **History Management**: Time-windowed behavior tracking per student
- ✅ **Multi-track Support**: Concurrent monitoring of multiple students

### 2. Rule Types Implemented
- ✅ **Normal Behavior**: No flags active (Green)
- ✅ **Leaning Detection**: Persistent postural violations (Yellow)
- ✅ **Looking Around**: Head movement violations (Yellow)  
- ✅ **Phone Use**: Device usage detection (Orange)
- ✅ **Cheating Detection**: Complex pattern analysis (Red)

### 3. Advanced Features
- ✅ **Persistence Thresholds**: Configurable frame-based persistence (5 frames default)
- ✅ **Time Windows**: Behavioral analysis within configurable time windows (10s default)
- ✅ **Escalation Logic**: Phone use + suspicious behaviors → Cheating detection
- ✅ **Recovery Detection**: Automatic violation clearing when behavior normalizes

### 4. Configuration System
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All thresholds configurable via `.env`
- ✅ **BEHAVIOR_REPEAT_WINDOW**: 10.0 seconds
- ✅ **ALERT_PERSIST_FRAMES**: 5 frames
- ✅ **PHONE_REPEAT_THRESH**: 3 suspicious behaviors

## 📊 Validation Results

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **Policy Rules**: All 5 rule types validated
- ✅ **Input/Output Format**: Correct data structures
- ✅ **Persistence Logic**: Frame-based threshold enforcement
- ✅ **Time Management**: Window-based behavior analysis
- ✅ **Multi-tracking**: Concurrent student monitoring
- ✅ **Integration**: Complete pipeline with pose detection

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ **Real-time Ready**: Optimized for live video processing
- ✅ **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup of expired events
- ✅ **Scalable**: Supports multiple concurrent tracks
- ✅ **Reliable**: Robust error handling and edge cases

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Input Format (from Pose Detector)
```python
{
    'track_id': str,      # Person identifier
    'lean_flag': bool,    # Leaning behavior detected
    'look_flag': bool,    # Looking around detected  
    'phone_flag': bool    # Phone proximity detected
}
```

### Output Format (to Alert System)
```python
{
    'track_id': str,        # Person identifier
    'label': str,           # Violation type
    'severity': Severity,   # Color-coded severity
    'start_ts': float,      # Start timestamp
    'end_ts': float,        # End timestamp
    'confidence': float,    # Detection confidence
    'details': str          # Detailed description
}
```

### Severity Levels
| Level | Color | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Normal | 🟢 Green | No violations | Student working normally |
| Leaning | 🟡 Yellow | Postural violation | Persistent leaning behavior |
| Looking | 🟡 Yellow | Head movement | Looking around frequently |
| Phone Use | 🟠 Orange | Device detected | Phone near torso region |
| Cheating | 🔴 Red | Major violation | Phone + suspicious behaviors |
