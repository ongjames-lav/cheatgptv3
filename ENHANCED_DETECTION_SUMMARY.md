# CheatGPT3 Enhanced Pose Detection & Rules Optimization

## 🚀 **Ultra-Sensitive Configuration Applied**

### ⚡ **Performance Thresholds**
- **Lean Detection**: 10° → **6°** (70% more sensitive)
- **Head Turn Detection**: 12° → **8°** (33% more sensitive)
- **Phone IoU Threshold**: 0.02 → **0.01** (50% more sensitive)
- **Policy Window**: 3s → **2s** (33% faster response)
- **Alert Frames**: Still **1 frame** (immediate detection)

## 🔍 **Enhanced Head Turning Detection**

### 📊 **Multiple Detection Methods**
1. **Eye-based Yaw Analysis**
   - Enhanced eye separation ratio calculation
   - Adaptive thresholds based on face size
   - Directional detection (left/right)
   - Eye vertical alignment compensation

2. **Ear-based Verification**
   - Secondary confirmation using ear positions
   - Single ear visibility detection (strong turn indicator)
   - Combined ear-eye analysis for accuracy

3. **Nose Position Analysis**
   - Nose offset relative to eye center
   - Cross-verification with eye-based detection
   - Enhanced pitch calculation

4. **Comprehensive Angle Calculation**
   - Multi-method fusion for robust detection
   - Debug logging for real-time analysis
   - Direction-aware reporting (LEFT/RIGHT)

### 🎯 **Key Improvements**
- **Sensitivity**: Detects turns as small as 8°
- **Accuracy**: Multiple verification methods
- **Robustness**: Works with partial face visibility
- **Real-time**: Immediate detection and logging

## 🏗️ **Enhanced Leaning Detection**

### 📐 **Five Detection Methods**

1. **Shoulder Line Angle**
   - Most reliable for side leaning
   - Horizontal shoulder tilt measurement
   - Immediate detection of shoulder asymmetry

2. **Torso Centerline Deviation**
   - Classic shoulder-to-hip angle calculation
   - Vertical alignment assessment
   - Forward/backward lean detection

3. **Hip Line Angle**
   - Additional verification using hip positions
   - Hip tilt indicates body leaning
   - Secondary confirmation method

4. **Asymmetric Shoulder-Hip Distances**
   - Forward/backward lean detection
   - Left vs right side distance comparison
   - 15% asymmetry threshold for detection

5. **Single-Side Position Analysis**
   - Works when only one side is visible
   - Extreme position detection
   - Robust for partial body visibility

### 🎯 **Detection Capabilities**
- **Side Leaning**: Left/right body tilt
- **Forward/Backward**: Torso angle changes
- **Shoulder Drops**: Uneven shoulder positioning
- **Hip Shifts**: Lower body positioning
- **Partial Visibility**: Single-side detection

## 📱 **Enhanced Phone Detection**

### 🔍 **Improved Detection Area**
- **Expanded Detection Zone**: 30% wider margins around person
- **Overlap Ratio Calculation**: Additional detection method
- **IoU + Overlap**: Dual verification system
- **Ultra-low Threshold**: 0.01 IoU for maximum sensitivity

### 🎯 **Detection Improvements**
- **Sensitivity**: Detects phones at greater distances
- **Accuracy**: Reduced false negatives
- **Robustness**: Multiple detection algorithms
- **Real-time**: Immediate phone proximity alerts

## 🧠 **Optimized Rule System**

### ⚡ **Immediate Response Rules**
1. **Instant Cheating**: Phone + (Lean OR Look) = Immediate red alert
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Historical behavior tracking
3. **Single Frame Detection**: No waiting for multiple frames
4. **Auto-recovery**: Violations clear when normal behavior resumes

### 📊 **Detection Hierarchy**
1. **🔴 Cheating** (Immediate): Phone + Suspicious behavior
2. **🔴 Cheating** (Pattern): Phone + Historical violations  
3. **🟠 Phone Use**: Phone detected alone
4. **🟡 Looking Around**: Head turn detection
5. **🟡 Leaning**: Body position detection
6. **🟢 Normal**: No violations detected

## 🔧 **Debug & Monitoring**

### 📝 **Comprehensive Logging**
- **Real-time Behavior Analysis**: Live detection feedback
- **Method Attribution**: Which detection method triggered
- **Angle Measurements**: Precise degree measurements
- **Direction Detection**: Left/Right/Forward/Backward
- **Threshold Comparisons**: Current vs configured limits

### 🎯 **Debug Output Examples**
```
🔍 LEANING DETECTED: method=shoulder_tilt, angle=8.2°, threshold=6.0°
👁️ LOOKING AROUND DETECTED: direction=LEFT, yaw=12.3°, threshold=8.0°
📱 Phone detected near person: IoU=0.015, overlap=0.12
🚨 VIOLATION: Looking Around for person_001 - Looking around detected (1 recent frames)
```

## 🎮 **Testing Configuration**

### 🔧 **Ultra-Sensitive Settings**
```env
LEAN_ANGLE_THRESH=6.0
HEAD_TURN_THRESH=8.0
PHONE_IOU_THRESH=0.01
ALERT_PERSIST_FRAMES=1
BEHAVIOR_REPEAT_WINDOW=2.0
DEBUG_POLICY=true
DEBUG_POSE=true
DEBUG_ENGINE=true
```

### 🧪 **Expected Behavior**
- **Immediate Detection**: Single frame violations trigger alerts
- **Detailed Logging**: Real-time console feedback
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded bounding boxes
- **Direction Awareness**: Left/right turn detection
- **Method Transparency**: See which detection method triggered

## 🎯 **Testing Instructions**

### 📹 **Webcam Testing**
1. **Normal Posture**: Should show green box
2. **Slight Head Turn**: Should immediately show yellow with direction
3. **Small Lean**: Should immediately show yellow with method
4. **Phone Holding**: Should show orange/red instantly
5. **Combined Actions**: Should trigger immediate cheating alert

### 📊 **Expected Console Output**
```
INFO:cheatgpt.engine:Evaluating behavior for person_001: lean=False, look=True, phone=False
INFO:cheatgpt.policy.rules:LOOKING AROUND detected for person_001
🚨 VIOLATION: Looking Around for person_001 - Looking around detected (1 recent frames)
```
